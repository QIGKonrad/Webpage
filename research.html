                        <p class="mb-4">  Storing and processing information in individual quantum systems promises unprecedented computational power and communication security. Future computing  technology is anticipated to be partly based on the ability to manipulate individual atoms, nuclear spins or light particles (photons)  in  quantum computers. Encoding  information in single photons, the elementary building blocks of light, allows for the possibility to communicate securely. Any attempt to read out the information from the individual photons  is very likely to be detected because of the disturbance caused by such interventions. </p>

By means of spatial light modulators (SLMs) information can be encoded in the single photons. The SLMs are made from programmable liquid crystal displays (LCDs). </i></p>
                        <p class="mb-4">In close collaboration with the Structured Light Lab at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, the research group of Prof Konrad is studying the possibilities of quantum information processing and communication with light.  Our vision is to help to develop the technical means for a  global quantum network that can be used to transmit quantum information between quantum computing nodes or to send information secure against eavesdropping.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">Currently our research  is focused on encoding information in particular light modes so called Laguerre-Gauss (LG) modes that have corkscrew-like wave fronts and  carry orbital angular momentum. Compared to the polarisation of photons, spatial light modes have  a much higher storage capacity: A single photon can store only a basic unit of quantum information - one qubit- in its polarisation but nearly a higher number of qubits in superpositions of different spatial light modes. So far our studies with photons comprise three areas: a) Encoding and processing of  information and quantum correlations (entanglement) in LG modes, b) Study of information loss in transmission channels due to turbulence and c) quantum teleportation with spatial light modes.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4">In classical physics it is possible, in principle, to detect the state of a single system, for example the position and momentum of a point particle, transmit the information about that state to a remote location and then reconstruct it within a second system. This principle of “classical teleportation” underlies telecommunication techniques such as the transfer of documents via facsimile. Quantum physics, however, excludes the possibility to detect or duplicate the state of a single microscopic system  and thus rules out all forms of classical teleportation with atoms, photons or other quantum systems. It is thus surprising, that the state transfer between quantum systems can nevertheless be realized according to the rules of quantum physics by means of “quantum teleportation”. This procedure makes use of quantum correlations between quantum systems – entanglement- which is stronger than the usual correlations between classical particles. </p>
                        
                        <p class="mb-4">Quantum teleportation lies at the core of quantum communication which is the quantum analog of telecommunication, and can also be employed to enhance the success probability in quantum computing with photons. Moreover, it is one of the crucial ingredients for enabling long-distance quantum cryptography - a technique to transmit information secure against eavesdropping. </p>

The concept and  theory for this experiment conducted by Jonathan Leach’s group in Scotland was  jointly worked out by  Andrew Forbes (Wits), Jonathan  Leach (Heriot Watt), Stef Roux (NMISA) and Thomas Konrad (UKZN).</i></p>

In order to beat the best existing computers,  for example by calculating the factors of a large number faster,  a quantum computer would need approximately 10 000 qubits. Currently, quantum registers with only up to 70 qubits are available.  In this situation, we are searching for optical implementations. So far, we have designed  optical solutions  for some algorithms: the Deutsch, Deutsch-Josza, and the Grover algorithm. </p>

                        <p class="mb-4">Quantum control is considered much more difficult than the control of classical systems. This is not only due to the susceptibility of atoms and electrons to tiny disturbances because of their lack of inertia,  but also implied by the fundamental properties such as Heisenberg’s uncertainty, that forbids a quantum particle to be prepared with a precise position and momentum simultaneously. Moreover, high resolution  measurements lead to drastic state changes. For example, a sharp measurement  of the position of a particle would collapse the support of  the wave function to single point. In order to monitor the wave function of particles, unsharp indirect measurements can be used that induce weak state change but also offer little information gain. However, a sequence of such measurements can lead to faithful monitoring of the wave function, if its natural dynamics dominate the weak disturbances due to the measurements. </p>

Assuming that the system starts in the state on the equator of the sphere, a feedback operation returns it to its initial position (left diagramme).

For example in industry, costs and sustainability depends on the optimisation of production, storage and transport. Computing the optimal parameters for complex processes is exponentially hard, i.e. it requires exponentially growing computational time or register size on classical computers. </p>                  
                        <p class="mb-4">However there might exist algorithms for quantum computers that could solve such optimisation tasks efficiently (with polynomially growing resources). A practical challenge is that existing quantum computers are noisy, intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices, that make it difficult to gain a quantum advantage. </p>
                        <p class="mb-4">We are looking to solve optimisation problems on existing quantum computers encoding information in the  amplitudes of quantum states. Since the state of a quantum computer with 50 quantum bits ( a qubit is the basis unit of quantum information that can be stored in a quantum system with two basis states) is determined by a total of 2 to the power 50 basis states, it can thus store the same number of amplitudes. This corresponds to the values of  10 to the power 15 variables that can be processed in parallel.  However the main problem is how to read in and out these values. The QIGK is researching quantum optimisation algorithms and solutions to the input problem. </p>
